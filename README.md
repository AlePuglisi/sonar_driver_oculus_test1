# sonar_driver_oculus_ros2
ROS 2 sonar driver for the blueprint subsea oculus M3000d dual-frequency multi-beam imaging sonar

Code copied from [Tethys-Robotics-Team/sonar_driver](https://github.com/Tethys-Robotics-Team/sonar_driver).
Rebase for fixing some dependency problems in my machine and collecting both 
`sonar_driver` and `sonar_driver_interface` in a single repo.

**Maybe** planning to conteinerize the driver.
